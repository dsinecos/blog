        <p>English and German: Most of the time in these languages we don’t read the word as a combination of letters probably
            because they use Latin script. In fact, what we speak is the phonetic transcription of the words. examples: take
            two similar English words “put (/pʊt/)” and “cut (/kʌt/)” the ‘u’ in “put” is spoken with ‘ʊ’ sound but in “cut”
            it is having ‘ʌ’ sound. Similarly the German ‘G’ in “Tag” is pronounced like English ‘K’ but the same German
            ‘G’ in “Gut is pronounced like English ‘G’ itself.
